# Fitomo Prediction Service

  Fitomo Prediction Service is a tool to forecast users' future "health scores", based on their current steps, sleep and heart rate data as well as previous trends.

## Usage

  This service takes requests at '/api/getPrediction'; data to include is a dictionary with the following keys:
  ```sh
    steps
    total_sleep
    resting_hr
    step_week_slope
    sleep_week_slope
    hr_week_slope
  ```
  The service will then output the predicted health score (calculated using a gradient boosting regression).

## Getting started

#### 1. Clone the latest version

  Start by cloning the latest version of the Fitomo Prediction Service on your local machine by running:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/Fitomo/Prediction-Service.git
  $ cd Prediction-Service
  ```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
  From within the root directory run the following command to install all dependencies:

  ```sh
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

#### 3. Setup Environment Variables

  1. Run the following command in your terminal to refresh your bash profile:

  ```sh
  $ echo "source `which activate.sh`" >> ~/.bashrc
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  2. Refresh your bash profile by leaving then entering the directory:

  ```sh
  $ cd ..
  $ cd Prediction-Service
  ```

#### 4. Run the application

  Run the following command in your terminal to run the app:

  ```sh
  $ python app/app.py
